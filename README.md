# p5.js Albers' Homage Series

Welcome to the p5.js project inspired by Josef Albers' renowned series, "Homage to The Square," initiated in 1933 and spanning until the early 1970s.

## Project Overview

In this exploration, I draw inspiration from Albers' masterful color and form interactions. The goal is to experiment with p5.js and create a series that allows us to compare and analyze the dynamic interplay of colors and shapes.

## Features

- **Color Experimentation:** Engage in a visual journey experimenting with an array of colors and forms.
- **Interactive Analysis:** Explore the dynamic interactions between colors and shapes.
- **Historical Context:** Gain insights into Albers' artistic journey and the evolution of the "Homage to The Square" series.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred p5.js development environment.
3. Run the project to experience the interactive exploration of colors and forms.
