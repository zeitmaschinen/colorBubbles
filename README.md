## Josef Albers Project - Thinking with (p5.js and) Color

A p5.js project on Josef Albers pieces from the series "Homage to The Square". He started this series in 1933 and worked on those until early 1970's.
So I'm getting inspired by him and starting a series where I will be experimenting with p5 functions and adding interactions,
so we can compare and analyse the interaction between colours and forms.
